# Scripts from my Master's thesis 
This repository contains code for my master's thesis "A Bayesian cointegration testing procedure with conditional prior odds"
Written at the Aalto University School of Business, dept. of Finance

The script is heavily inspired by the work of Bracegirdle & Barber (Bayesian conditional cointegration, 2012), but is largely extended and modified by me.
The MIT license is there because of the influences in the code.
